Gems and Holiday Package Prediction: Utilized Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to make predictions

This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base or not.
